####  Data visualizations
```{r Data visualization}
#Import data
#list(here()) - you don't want this to run in your knitted document, so consider commenting it or creating a new code chunk for just this code and use echo = FALSE)
data <- import(here("Data", "Final_project_simulated_data.csv"))
#View(data)

#Calculate total scores
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(sq_total = SQ1 + SQ2 + SQ3 + SQ4, #It is good style to keep variable names lower case (and it might be                                         better if name was more informative to naive viewers[e.g., depression])
         mdd_total = MDD1 + MDD2 + MDD3,
         ql_total = QL1 + QL2 + QL3)

#Grouping by SES and creating a summary of MDD, SQ, and QL total scores
scorebyses <- data %>% #changed to lower case style
  group_by(SES) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mdd = mean(mdd_total),
            mean_sq = mean(sq_total),
            mean_ql = mean(ql_total))

#Table summary
kable(scorebyses,format = "html", digits = round(2)) #make variable names more informative so we can see what the table is showing.
#I rounded to 2 decimal places. 
#Also consider changing the levels of SES to have a space between the level and SES (e.g., High SES) or just use High, Middle, Low. 
```

```{r data_vis}
#Bar graph of MDD scores by SES
ggplot(scorebyses, aes(x = SES, y = mean_mdd, fill = SES)) + 
  geom_col(alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "MDD Scores by SES", y = "MDD Total Score") #What is MDD - make more descriptive. 
# I would have either a legend or labels, but not both since it is redundant. 
# Consider changing the location of Low and Middle SES so that the plot is more intuitive 
```

```{r Data visualization 2}
#Select and filter data
data_p <- data %>%  
                select(ID, SES, EN, sq_total, mdd_total, ql_total) %>% 
                filter(SES == "LowSES")

#Scatterplot of sleep quality vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = sq_total, y = mdd_total)) + #rename variables in tidy dataset to be informative and lower case
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Sleep Quality vs. Depression in low SES individuals",
       x = "Sleep Quality", 
       y = "Depression")
#GREAT PLOT!
```

```{r dv3}
#Scatterplot of quality of life vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = sq_total, y = ql_total)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Sleep Quality vs. Quality of Life in low SES individuals",
       x = "Sleep Quality", 
       y = "Quality of Life")
#Also a great plot, consider changing the colors around this time. 
```

```{r dv4}
#Scatterplot of quality of life vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = ql_total, y = mdd_total)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Quality of Life vs. Depression in low SES individuals",
       x = "Quality of Life", 
       y = "Depression")
```

The mean total depression score for the sample is `r round(mean(data$mdd_total), 2)` . The mean total sleep quality score for the sample is `r round(mean(data$sq_total), 2)`. The mean quality of life score for the sample is `r round(mean(data$ql_total),2)`. **ST changed the last code to be ql_total instead of MDDtotal**

#### Demonstrate tidying messy data
```{r gather, separate, select, filter & spread}
# this may not be actually helpful with data analysis but it demonstrates how to run those functions
Main_measure_data <- data %>%
  select(ID, SQ1:QL3) %>% 
  gather(items, value, -1) %>% 
  separate(items, c("Measure", "Item number"), sep = "(?=[:digit:])", convert = TRUE)

# again, not really helpful output but it shows how we have different columns for each race/ethnicity
EN_data <- data %>%
  select(ID, SES:EN) %>% 
  spread(key = EN, value = SES) %>% 
  filter(ED == "Postsecondary certificate")
```
