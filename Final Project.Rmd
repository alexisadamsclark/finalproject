####  Data visualizations
```{r Data visualization}
#Import data
list(here())
data <- import(here("Data", "Final_project_simulated_data.csv"))
#View(data)

#Calculate total scores
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(sq_total = SQ1 + SQ2 + SQ3 + SQ4, #It is good style to keep variable names lower case - and would be better if name was more informative to naive viewers)
         mdd_total = MDD1 + MDD2 + MDD3,
         ql_total = QL1 + QL2 + QL3)

#Grouping by SES and creating a summary of MDD, SQ, and QL total scores
scorebyses <- data %>% #lower case style
  group_by(SES) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mdd = mean(MDDtotal),
            mean_sq = mean(SQtotal),
            mean_ql = mean(QLtotal))

#Table summary
kable(scorebyses)

#Bar graph of MDD scores by SES
ggplot(scorebyses, aes(x = SES, y = mean_mdd, fill = SES)) + 
  geom_col(alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "MDD Scores by SES", y = "MDD Total Score") #What is MDD - make more descriptive. 
# I would have either a legend or labels, but not both since it is redundant. 
```

```{r Data visualization 2}
#Select and filter data
data_p <- data %>%  
                select(ID, SES, EN, SQtotal, MDDtotal, QLtotal) %>% 
                filter(SES == "LowSES")

#Scatterplot of sleep quality vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = SQtotal, y = MDDtotal)) + #rename variables in tidy dataset to be informative and lower case
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Sleep Quality vs. Depression in low SES individuals",
       x = "Sleep Quality", 
       y = "Depression")
#GREAT PLOT!
```

```{r dv3}
#Scatterplot of quality of life vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = SQtotal, y = QLtotal)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Sleep Quality vs. Quality of Life in low SES individuals",
       x = "Sleep Quality", 
       y = "Quality of Life")
#Also a great plot, consider changing the colors around this time. 
```

```{r dv4}
#Scatterplot of quality of life vs. depression
ggplot(data_p, aes(x = QLtotal, y = MDDtotal)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter", alpha = 0.7) + #misspelled alpha
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Quality of Life vs. Depression in low SES individuals",
       x = "Quality of Life", 
       y = "Depression")
```

The mean total depression score for the sample is `r round(mean(data$MDDtotal), 2)` . The mean total sleep quality score for the sample is `r round(mean(data$SQtotal), 2)`. The mean quality of life score for the sample is`r round(mean(data$MDDtotal),2)`. 

#### Demonstrate tidying messy data
```{r gather, separate, select, filter & spread}
# this may not be actually helpful with data analysis but it demonstrates how to run those functions
Main_measure_data <- data %>%
  select(ID, SQ1:QL3) %>% 
  gather(items, value, -1) %>% 
  separate(items, c("Measure", "Item number"), sep = "(?=[:digit:])", convert = TRUE)

# again, not really helpful output but it shows how we have different columns for each race/ethnicity
EN_data <- data %>%
  select(ID, SES:EN) %>% 
  spread(key = EN, value = SES) %>% 
  filter(ED == "Postsecondary certificate")
```
