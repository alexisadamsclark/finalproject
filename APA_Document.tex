\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Sleep quality, typically indexed by a combination of sleep efficiency and total sleep time (TST), is an increasing important outcome in the context of long-term health. While sleep efficiency is defined as the percentage of time spent sleeping while laying in bed. Whereas, total sleep time is the amount of time spent sleeping, accounting for factors such as sleep onset latency and awakenings. There is a multitude of studies that evidence poor sleep as a prospective risk factor in premature mortality. More specifically, chronically disrupted and limited sleep has been linked to increased rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and mental health disorders (Knutson et al., 2007; Gangwisch et al., 2005). 

Additionally, recent epidemiological research suggests that sleep has continued to decrease over the past 30 years, which is consistent with the significant increase in sleep-related complaints in the workforce (Ferrie et al., 2011). In this review by Ferrie and colleagues, the reduction in sleep quality is also thought to be associated with the staggering increase in work-related and vehicular accidents. While research has provided evidence between sleep quality and health-outcomes, there are few studies examining other global measures such as quality of life.

Quality of life is a helpful and comprehensive measure of an individualâ€™s subjective experience. For example, this variable may encompass interpersonal and familial relationships, occupational satisfaction, financial security, and intellectual development. While there may be tangible health-related outcomes (e.g., number of hospital visits), the subjective interpretation of distressing impairments due to poor sleep quality may also provide valuable insights. This overall outcome can adequately capture subthreshold depressive symptoms, which may still benefit from various interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia).

While this global measure may capture the negative impact of poor sleep quality through broad strokes, depression is a more clinically-specific outcome to consider. Depressive symptoms, such as low mood and irritability, have been consistently linked to sleep-related psychopathology (Spoormaker & van den Bout, 2005). This pattern of poor sleep quality may increase obstacles associated with obtaining reliable treatment by exacerbating current depressive symptoms. Therefore, sleep quality seems to be at the root of these domain-spanning impairments, and an essential target for intervention.

In this present study, we set out to evaluate evidence for the association between sleep quality, depression, and quality of life in a sample of diverse sample of adults. These relationships will also be investigated in the context of low, medium, and high SES as a moderator. Given the importance of sleep quality and mental health on long-term health outcomes, we hope to enrich the current literature with a better understanding of these complex factors. Findings from this study will inform models of psychopathology and provide a foundation from which causal and longitudinal intervention-focused research can be constructed.

\section{\texorpdfstring{Methods\footnote{This is a fictional Methods section, as we simulated our data. However, this is a realistic way that we could go about collecting this information in the future}}{Methods}}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Participants were recruited through the University of Oregon Human
Subjects Pool consisting of undergraduate students enrolled in
introductory psychology and linguistics courses. Students received
academic credit in exchange for their participants. Participants were
not aware of the subject of the study before scheduling their
participation, so participants did not self-select into the study.
Although they could leave the study after reading informed consent, no
participants chose to do so.

In total, {[}\#{]} participants were included in this study, all of who
had complete data. {[}insert demographic characteristics{]}

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

\subsubsection{Depressive Symptoms
Scale}\label{depressive-symptoms-scale}

A scale to measure depressive symptoms was created by the researchers
for the purposes of this study. Participants were instructed to rate
each item on Likert-type scale, where 1 corresponds to \enquote{strongly
disagree,} and 5 corresponds to \enquote{strongly agree.} The scale
consisted of three items, including: \enquote{Over the last 2 weeks, I
have felt little interest or pleasure in doing things;} \enquote{Over
the last 2 weeks, I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless;} and
\enquote{Over the last 2 weeks, I have felt tired or had little energy.}
Scale items were summed to create a depression score, where higher
scores represent higher depressive symptoms.

\subsubsection{Quality of Life Scale}\label{quality-of-life-scale}

A scale to measure participants' quality of life was created by the
researchers. Participants were instructed to rate each item on
Likert-type scale, where 1 corresponds to \enquote{strongly disagree,}
and 5 corresponds to \enquote{strongly agree.} The scale consisted of
four items, including: \enquote{My life is ideal;} \enquote{I am
satisfied with my life;} \enquote{So far I have been able get the
important things I want from life;} and \enquote{I have accomplished
many of the things in my life.} Scale items were summed to create a
total quality of life score, where higher scores represent better
quality of life.

\subsubsection{Sleep Quality Scale}\label{sleep-quality-scale}

A scale to measure participants' sleep quality was created by the
researchers. Participants were instructed to rate each item on
Likert-type scale, where 1 corresponds to \enquote{strongly disagree,}
and 5 corresponds to \enquote{strongly agree.} The scale consisted of
three items, including: \enquote{I am satisfied with the time I spend
sleeping;} \enquote{I am satisfied with my quality of sleep}; and
\enquote{When I wake up, I feel refreshed.} Scale items were summed to
create a total sleep quality score, where higher scores represent better
sleep quality.

\subsubsection{Demographics
Questionnaire}\label{demographics-questionnaire}

Participants were also asked to complete a demongraphics quationnaire,
which asked about their socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and
educational background.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

An online version of this study was created through Qualtrics survey
software, and the survey link was distributed to participants on the via
SONA software through the University of Oregon Human Subjects pool.
After clicking the survey link, participants were informed of study
procedures and content through an informed consent process. After
completing the study, participants received academic credit as
compensation and were presented with debriefing materials. The
University of Oregon's s Office of Research Compliance (Institutional
Review Board) approved this study.

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

We used R (Version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2017) and the R-packages
\emph{bindrcpp} (Version 0.2.2; MÃ¼ller, 2018), \emph{dplyr} (Version
0.7.6; Wickham, FranÃ§ois, Henry, \& MÃ¼ller, 2018), \emph{forcats}
(Version 0.3.0; Wickham, 2018a), \emph{Formula} (Version 1.2.3; Zeileis
\& Croissant, 2010), \emph{ggplot2} (Version 3.0.0; Wickham, 2016),
\emph{gridExtra} (Version 2.3; Auguie, 2017), \emph{here} (Version 0.1;
MÃ¼ller, 2017), \emph{Hmisc} (Version 4.1.1; Harrell Jr, Charles Dupont,
\& others., 2018), \emph{janitor} (Version 1.1.1; Firke, 2018),
\emph{kableExtra} (Version 0.9.0; Zhu, 2018), \emph{knitr} (Version
1.20; Xie, 2015), \emph{lattice} (Version 0.20.35; Sarkar, 2008),
\emph{papaja} (Version 0.1.0.9842; Aust \& Barth, 2018), \emph{purrr}
(Version 0.2.5; Henry \& Wickham, 2018), \emph{readr} (Version 1.1.1;
Wickham, Hester, \& Francois, 2017), \emph{rio} (Version 0.5.10; C.-h.
Chan, Chan, Leeper, \& Becker, 2018), \emph{stringr} (Version 1.3.1;
Wickham, 2018b), \emph{survival} (Version 2.42.6; Terry M. Therneau \&
Patricia M. Grambsch, 2000), \emph{tibble} (Version 1.4.2; MÃ¼ller \&
Wickham, 2018), \emph{tidyr} (Version 0.8.1; Wickham \& Henry, 2018),
and \emph{tidyverse} (Version 1.2.1; Wickham, 2017) for all our
analyses. We calculated means and standard deviations for each of the
total scale scores. We also calculated Pearson's r correlation
coefficients between depressive symptoms, quality of life, and sleep
quality total scores. The authors interpreted our correlational results
as small (.10-.29), medium (.30-.49), and large correlations (.50-1.00).
